        "Budoco" is a (so far) minimalist rewrite of <b>Bu</b>gtracker.NET using Microsoft's <b>Do</b>tnet <b>Co</b>re.

        I first released BugTracker.NET in 2001, originally to learn the hot new language C#.
        Within a couple years BugTracker.NET was pretty solid.
        Probably thousands of organziations used it and maybe many are still using it.

        It runs only on Windows and uses MS SQL Server.
    </p>
    <p>
        But, time moves on.
    </p>
    <p>
        I moved on to other technologies, and then retired and stopped coding in 2016, except for a few BugTracker.NET
        fixes.
        <br>
        Dev teams moved on to Github and Jira for their issue tracking needs.
        <br>
        Microsoft moved on too, from classic ASP.NET to Dotnet Core.
    </p>
    <p>
        But then...2020: I started writing Budoco in November 2020 in order to distract myself from election anxiety and
        to break the
        COVID-19 monotony.
    <p>
        Budoco runs on Microsoft's cross-platform Dotnet Core 5.
        I've been developing it on Linux Mint, based on Ubuntu 20.04.
        It uses Postgres as its database.
